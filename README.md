# IP Tracker Discord Bot

## Overview
This bot allows users in a Discord server to create private channels where they can track IP addresses and retrieve basic geolocation data such as city, region, country, and ISP information.

## Features
- **IP Lookup**: Users can track an IP address and get details about the geolocation and ISP.
- **Private Channels**: Each user's request creates a private channel for their IP lookup session, ensuring privacy.
- **Simple Commands**: The bot is easy to use with simple commands starting with `?track`.

## Commands
- `?track`: Initiates the tracking process. The bot will create a private channel and instruct the user to provide the IP address they wish to track.

## Setup and Installation
